Here you can make USB-related settings for when the GX-1 is connected to a computer via USB.

| Parameter | Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| EFX OUT LVL | 0–200% | Adjusts the level of audio output to the computer after passing through the effects of the GX-1. |
| MIX LEVEL | 0–200% | Adjusts the level of the input sound from the computer. With this setting, the input sound from the computer is mixed into the final stage of the GX-1 signal chain. |
| DRY OUT | 0–200% | The guitar sound that is input to the GX-1, is output without change (DRY sound); it is not processed by effects. |
| DRY TO EFX (INPUT TO EFX) | 0–200% | Adjusts the input level from the computer to the GX-1’s effects. |
| DIR.MON. (DIRECT MONITOR) | Selects whether the sound of the GX-1, is output to the PHONES jack or the OUTPUT jacks.   * This setting cannot be saved. It will be ON when the unit is powered-on. |  |
|  | OFF | Turn this off if the audio data is being passed through within the computer.  In this case, you won’t hear the sound unless the computer is set to through. |
|  | ON | The sound of the GX-1 is output directly. Turn this on if you’re using the GX-1, by itself without connecting to a computer. (If this is off, only the sound that is input to USB will be output.) |
| LOOPBACK | OFF, ON | Turn this ON to send the sound mixed from the computer with the GX-1’s effect sound to your computer. |
| USB DRIVER | VENDOR | When connecting to a Windows or macOS device, use the “VENDOR” setting.  Install the GX-1 driver that you downloaded from the BOSS website. |
|  | GENERIC | When connecting to an iOS device, use the “GENERIC” setting. The unit operates using standard iOS functionality. Some functions may be limited when compared with the VENDOR setting. |
