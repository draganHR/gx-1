| Parameter | Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ON/OFF | OFF, ON | Turns this effect on/off. |
| PATTERN | P01–P20 | Selects the rhythm pattern used to slice up the sound. |
| RATE | 0–100, BPMŀ–Ō | Adjusts the rate at which the sound is sliced.   * When set to BPM, the value of each parameter will be set according to the value of the “MASTER BPM” specified for each memory. This makes it easier to achieve effect sound settings that match the tempo of the song. * If, due to the tempo, the time is longer than the range of allowable settings, it is then synchronized to a period either 1/2 or 1/4 of that time. * ŀ is a double whole note, which is twice as long as a whole note. |
| LEVEL | 0–100 | Adjusts the volume. |
| ATTACK | 0–100 | Adjusts the attack volume for the rhythm pattern. |
| DUTY | 1–99 | Adjusts the duration of the sound for the rhythm pattern. |
