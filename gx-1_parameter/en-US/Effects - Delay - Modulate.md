This delay adds a pleasant wavering effect to the sound.

| Parameter | Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TIME | 1–2000 ms, BPM Ō–ŀ | Adjusts the delay time.   * When set to BPM, the value of each parameter will be set according to the value of the “MASTER BPM” specified for each memory. This makes it easier to achieve effect sound settings that match the tempo of the song. * If, due to the tempo, the time is longer than the range of allowable settings, it is then synchronized to a period either 1/2 or 1/4 of that time. * ŀ is a double whole note, which is twice as long as a whole note. |
| FEEDBACK | 0–100 | Adjusts the volume of delay that is returned to the input. Higher settings will result in more delay repeats. |
| LEVEL | 1–120 | Adjusts the volume of the delay sound. |
| HIGH CUT | 20.0 Hz–12.5 kHz, FLAT | Sets the frequency at which the high cut filter begins to take effect. When FLAT is selected, the high cut filter has no effect. |
| MOD RATE | 0–100 | Adjusts the modulation rate of the delay sound. |
| MOD DEPTH | 0–100 | Adjusts the modulation depth of the delay sound. |
