# Humanizer

![](../Images/png/91951371__Web.png)HEXARAY: Level meter

This alters the guitar audio signal to give it a human-like vocalized sound.

| Parameter | Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ON/OFF | OFF, ON | Turns this effect on/off. |
| MODE | This sets the mode for switching the vowels. |  |
|  | PICKING | Switches from VOWEL1 to VOWEL2 according to your picking. The RATE adjusts the time it takes to switch the vowels. |
|  | AUTO | Adjusts the RATE and DEPTH used for switching between the two vowels (VOWEL1 and VOWEL2). |
| VOWEL1 | a, e, i, o, u | Selects the first vowel. |
| VOWEL2 | a, e, i, o, u | Selects the second vowel. |
| SENS \*1 | 0–100 | Adjusts the sensitivity of the humanizer. When it is set to a lower value, no effect of the humanizer is obtained with weaker picking, while stronger picking produces the effect.  When it is set to a higher value, the effect of the humanizer can be obtained whether the picking is weak or strong. |
| RATE | 0–100 ms, BPM ŀ–Ō | Adjusts the cycle for changing the two vowels.   * When set to BPM, the value of each parameter will be set according to the value of the “MASTER BPM” specified for each memory. This makes it easier to achieve effect sound settings that match the tempo of the song. * If, due to the tempo, the time is longer than the range of allowable settings, it is then synchronized to a period either 1/2 or 1/4 of that time. * ŀ is a double whole note, which is twice as long as a whole note. |
| MANUAL \*2 | 0–100 | Adjusts the cycle for changing the two vowels. When this is set to 50, the time it takes to switch between vowels 1 and 2 is the same; and when this is set to a value lower than 50, the time it takes to switch to VOWEL1 is shorter. When it is set to higher than 50, the time for VOWEL 1 is longer. |
| LEVEL | 0–100 | Adjusts the volume. |
