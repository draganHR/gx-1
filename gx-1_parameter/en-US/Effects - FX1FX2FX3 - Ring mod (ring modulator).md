# Ring mod (ring modulator)

This creates a bell-like sound by ring-modulating the guitar sound with the signal from the internal oscillator. The sound can be unmusical and lack distinctive pitches.

| Parameter | Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ON/OFF | OFF, ON | Turns this effect on/off. |
| INTELLIGENT | OFF, ON | If this is ON, the oscillator frequency changes according to the pitch of the input sound, producing a pitched sound. In this case, the expected effect does not occur if the pitch of the guitar sound is not detected correctly. This effect does not give a satisfactory result if the pitch of the guitar sound is not correctly detected. |
| FREQ | 0–100 | Adjusts the frequency of the internal oscillator. |
| MOD RATE | 0–100, BPMŀ–Ō | Adjusts the rate at which the internal oscillator is modulated.   * When set to BPM, the value of each parameter will be set according to the value of the “MASTER BPM” specified for each memory. This makes it easier to achieve effect sound settings that match the tempo of the song. * If, due to the tempo, the time is longer than the range of allowable settings, it is then synchronized to a period either 1/2 or 1/4 of that time. * ŀ is a double whole note, which is twice as long as a whole note. |
| MOD DEPTH | 0–100 | Adjusts the depth to which the internal oscillator is modulated. |
| LEVEL | 0–100 | Adjusts the volume of the effect sound. |
| DIRECT | 0–100 | Adjusts the volume of the direct sound. |
