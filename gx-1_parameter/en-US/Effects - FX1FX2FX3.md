## FX1/FX2/FX3 FX TYPE

This is a list of the effects that can be selected for FX1/FX2/FX3.

| Effect name | | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPRESSOR | Compressor | This is an effect that produces a long sustain by evening out the volume level of the input signal. |
| LIMITER | Limiter | Attenuates loud input levels to prevent distortion. |
| ENHANCER | Enhancer | This emphasizes the attack portion of the sound according to the changes in input level, adding more definition to the input audio. |
| TOUCH WAH | Touch wah | You can produce a wah effect with the filter changing in response to the guitar volume. |
| AUTO WAH | Auto wah | This effect changes the filtering over a periodic cycle, producing an automatic wah effect. |
| FIXED WAH | Fixed wah | Gives a wah effect when the wah pedal is stopped at a midrange position. |
| DEFRETTER | Defretter | This simulates a fretless guitar. |
| SLOW GEAR | Slow gear | This produces a volume-swell effect (“violin-like” sound). |
| AC. GTR SIM | Acoustic guitar simulator | This effect simulates the tonal character of an acoustic guitar. |
| AC RESO | Acoustic resonance | This processor allows you to change the sound produced by the pickup on an acoustic electric guitar, creating a richer sound similar to that obtained with a microphone placed close to the guitar. |
| SITAR SIM | Sitar simulator | This effect simulates the sound of the sitar. |
| FEEDBACKER | Feedbacker | Generates feedback. |
| OD/DS | Overdrive distortion | This effect distorts the sound to create long sustain. |
| PARA. EQ | Parametric equalizer | This adjusts the tone. You can adjust the sound character in three bands. |
| GEQ | Graphic equalizer | This adjusts the tone. You can adjust the sound character in six bands. |
| LOW GEQ | Low graphic equalizer | This adjusts the tone. You can adjust six bands in the lower frequency range. |
| HIGH GEQ | High graphic equalizer | This adjusts the tone. You can adjust six bands in the higher frequency range. |
| CHORUS | Chorus | This is an effect that adds a slightly modulated sound to the direct signal, creating beautiful spaciousness and depth. |
| FLANGER | Flanger | The flanger effect gives a twisting, jet-airplane-like character to the sound. |
| PHASER | Phaser | Gives a whooshing, swirling character to the sound by adding varied-phase portions to the direct sound. |
| SCRIPT PH | Script phaser | Models the MXR Phase 90 which was manufactured during the ‘70s. |
| CLASSIC-VIBE | Classic vibe | Although this resembles a phaser effect, it also provides a unique undulation that you can’t get with a regular phaser. |
| ROTARY | Rotary | This produces an effect like the sound of a rotary speaker. |
| VIBRATO | Vibrato | This effect creates vibrato by slightly modulating the pitch. |
| TREMOLO | Tremolo | This effect creates a cyclic change in volume. |
| SLICER | Slicer | This consecutively interrupts (or slices) the sound to create the effect of a rhythm backing phrase being played. |
| PAN | Pan | With the volume level of the left and right sides alternately changing, when playing sound in stereo, you can get an effect that makes the guitar sound appear to fly back and forth between the speakers. |
| RING MOD | Ring modulator | This creates a bell-like sound by ring-modulating the guitar sound with the signal from the internal oscillator. The sound can be unmusical and lack distinctive pitches. |
| HUMANIZER | Humanizer | This alters the guitar audio signal to give it a human-like vocalized sound. |
| PITCH SHIFT | Pitch shifter | This effect changes the pitch of the original sound (up or down) within a range of two octaves. |
| HARMONIST | Harmonist | Harmonist is an effect where the amount of shifting is adjusted according to an analysis of the guitar input, allowing you to create harmony based on diatonic scales. |
| OCTAVE | Octave | This adds a note one octave lower and a note two octaves lower, creating a richer sound. |
| HEAVY OCT | Heavy octave | Adds pitches one and two octaves lower than the input audio. This also applies when you play chords, adding thickness to the chords you play. |
| S-BEND | S-bend | Gives a pitch shift up/down effect that’s not possible when using typical guitar vibrato bar techniques. |
| PEDAL BEND | Pedal bend | This is a pitch bend effect that’s controlled by operating the expression pedal on this unit or by using an expression pedal connected to the CTL 2, 3/EXP 2 jack. |
| TUNE DOWN | Tune down | Gives the effect of tuning your guitar lower. |
| DELAY | Delay | This effect adds delayed sound to the direct sound, to give more body to the sound or create special effects. |
