You can produce a wah effect with the filter changing in response to the guitar volume.

| Parameter | Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ON/OFF | OFF, ON | Turns this effect on/off. |
| FILTER | Select the wah mode. | |
| LPF | Low pass filter. Passes only the low-frequency region. |
| BPF | Band pass filter. Passes only the specified frequency region. |
| HPF | High pass filter. Passes only the high-frequency region. |
| POLARITY | Selects the direction in which the filter changes in response to the input. | |
| DOWN | The frequency of the filter falls. |
| UP | The frequency of the filter rises. |
| SENS | 0–100 | Specifies the sensitivity with which the filter moves in the direction specified by the POLARITY setting.  Higher values produce a stronger tone which emphasizes the wah effect. The strength of picking has no effect when this is set to “0”. |
| LEVEL | 0–100 | Adjusts the volume. |
| FREQ | 0–100 | Adjusts the center frequency of the wah effect. |
| RESO | 0–100 | Adjusts the intensity of the wah effect in the area around the center frequency.  Higher values produce a stronger filter tone that emphasizes the wah effect. A value of 50 produces a standard wah sound. |
| DECAY | 0–100 | Adjusts the rate at which the filter is moved. |
