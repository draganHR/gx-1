This produces an effect like the sound of a rotary speaker.

| Parameter | Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ON/OFF | OFF, ON | Turns this effect on/off. |
| SPEED SELECT | SLOW, FAST | This parameter changes the simulated speaker’s rotating speed (SLOW or FAST). |
| SLOW RATE | 0–100, BPMŀ–Ō | This parameter adjusts the SPEED SELECT of rotation when set to “SLOW”.   * When set to BPM, the value of each parameter will be set according to the value of the “MASTER BPM” specified for each memory. This makes it easier to achieve effect sound settings that match the tempo of the song. * If, due to the tempo, the time is longer than the range of allowable settings, it is then synchronized to a period either 1/2 or 1/4 of that time. * ŀ is a double whole note, which is twice as long as a whole note. |
| FAST RATE | 0–100, BPMŀ–Ō | This parameter adjusts the SPEED SELECT of rotation when set to “FAST”.   * When set to BPM, the value of each parameter will be set according to the value of the “MASTER BPM” specified for each memory. This makes it easier to achieve effect sound settings that match the tempo of the song. * If, due to the tempo, the time is longer than the range of allowable settings, it is then synchronized to a period either 1/2 or 1/4 of that time. * ŀ is a double whole note, which is twice as long as a whole note. |
| LEVEL | 0–100 | Adjusts the volume. |
| BALANCE | 0–100 | Adjusts the balance between the treble rotor and the bass rotor. |
| DRIVE | 0–100 | Adjusts the amount of distortion in the preamp. |
