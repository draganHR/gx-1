Produces a dream-like sound.

| Parameter | Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ON/OFF | OFF, ON | Turns this effect on/off. |
| TIME | 1ms–2000ms, BPM ŀ–Ō | Adjusts the delay time.   * When set to BPM, the value of each parameter will be set according to the value of the “MASTER BPM” specified for each memory. This makes it easier to achieve effect sound settings that match the tempo of the song. * If, due to the tempo, the time is longer than the range of allowable settings, it is then synchronized to a period either 1/2 or 1/4 of that time. * ŀ is a double whole note, which is twice as long as a whole note. |
| TRIGGER | OFF, ON | If this is ON, the WARP effect is applied. |
| LEVEL | 0–100 | Adjusts the volume of the effect sound. |
