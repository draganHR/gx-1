This is an effect that adds a slightly modulated sound to the direct signal, creating beautiful spaciousness and depth.

| Parameter | Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ON/OFF | OFF, ON | Turns this effect on/off. |
| TYPE | Selects the chorus type. |  |
|  | MONO | This chorus effect outputs the same sound from both L channel and R channel. |
|  | DIR/EFX | This stereo chorus uses spatial synthesis, with the direct sound output in the L channel and the effect sound output in the R channel. |
|  | STEREO | This is a stereo chorus effect that adds different chorus sounds to L channel and R channel. |
| RATE | 0–100, BPMŀ–Ō | Adjusts the rate of the chorus effect.   * When set to BPM, the value of each parameter will be set according to the value of the “MASTER BPM” specified for each memory. This makes it easier to achieve effect sound settings that match the tempo of the song. * If, due to the tempo, the time is longer than the range of allowable settings, it is then synchronized to a period either 1/2 or 1/4 of that time. * ŀ is a double whole note, which is twice as long as a whole note. |
| DEPTH | 0–100 | Adjusts the depth of the chorus effect. To use this as a doubling effect, set this to “0”. |
| LEVEL | 0–100 | Adjusts the volume. |
| PRE-DELAY | 0.0 ms–40.0 ms | Adjusts the time needed for the effect sound to be output after the direct sound has been output. By setting a longer pre delay time, you can obtain an effect that sounds like more than one sound is being played at the same time (doubling effect). |
