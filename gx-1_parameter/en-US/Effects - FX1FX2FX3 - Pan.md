![](../Images/png/91951371__Web.png)HEXARAY: Tempo and stereo level meter

With the volume level of the left and right sides alternately changing, when playing sound in stereo, you can get an effect that makes the guitar sound appear to fly back and forth between the speakers.

| Parameter | Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ON/OFF | OFF, ON | Turns this effect on/off. |
| RATE | 0–100, BPMŀ–Ō | Adjusts the frequency (speed) of the volume change.   * When set to BPM, the value of each parameter will be set according to the value of the “MASTER BPM” specified for each memory. This makes it easier to achieve effect sound settings that match the tempo of the song. * If, due to the tempo, the time is longer than the range of allowable settings, it is then synchronized to a period either 1/2 or 1/4 of that time. * ŀ is a double whole note, which is twice as long as a whole note. |
| DEPTH | 0–100 | Adjusts the depth of the volume change. |
| LEVEL | 0–100 | Adjusts the volume. |
