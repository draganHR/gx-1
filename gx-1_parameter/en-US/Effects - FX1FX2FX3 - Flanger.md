The flanger effect gives a twisting, jet-airplane-like character to the sound.

| Parameter | Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ON/OFF | OFF, ON | Turns this effect on/off. |
| RATE | 0–100, BPMŀ–Ō | Sets the rate of the flanging effect.   * When set to BPM, the value of each parameter will be set according to the value of the “MASTER BPM” specified for each memory. This makes it easier to achieve effect sound settings that match the tempo of the song. * If, due to the tempo, the time is longer than the range of allowable settings, it is then synchronized to a period either 1/2 or 1/4 of that time. * ŀ is a double whole note, which is twice as long as a whole note. |
| DEPTH | 0–100 | Determines the depth of the flanging effect. |
| MANUAL | 0–100 | Adjusts the center frequency at which to apply the effect. |
| RESO | 0–100 | Determines the amount of resonance (feedback). Increasing the value emphasizes the effect, for a more unusual sound. |
| LEVEL | 0–100 | Adjusts the volume. |
