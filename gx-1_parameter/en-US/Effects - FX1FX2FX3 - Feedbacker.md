Generates feedback.

| Parameter | Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ON/OFF | OFF, ON | Turns this effect on/off. |
| MODE | NORMAL | Analyzes the pitch of the guitar sound being input, and then creates a feedback sound. |
|  | OSC | A simulated feedback sound is created internally. When OSC is selected, the effect is activated after a single note is played and the note stabilizes. A feedback effect is created when the effect switches on. The feedback disappears when the effect is switched off. |
| TRIGGER | OFF, ON | Feedback is applied if this is turned ON. |
| DEPTH \*1 | 0–100 | Adjusts how readily the feedback occurs when the effect is on. |
| RISE TIME \*2 | 0–100 | Adjusts the time needed for the volume of the feedback sound to reach its maximum after you switch the effect on. |
| OCT RISE TM \*2 | 0–100 | Adjusts the time needed for the volume of the feedback sound that’s one octave higher to reach its maximum after you switch the effect on. |
| FEEDBACK \*2 | 0–100 | Adjusts the volume of the feedback sound. |
| OCT F-BACK \*2 | 0–100 | Adjusts the volume of the feedback sound that’s one octave higher . |
