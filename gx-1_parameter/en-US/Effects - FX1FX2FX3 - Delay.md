# Delay

![](../Images/png/91951371__Web.png)HEXARAY: Tempo and stereo level meter

This produces a variety of delay sounds ranging from simple effects to richly idiosyncratic sounds. This effect is a useful way of adding depth to the sound.

| Parameter | Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ON/OFF | OFF, ON | Turns this effect on/off. |
| TYPE | Selects the type of wah. | |
| STANDARD | Delays the sound to create an echo-like effect. |
| MODULATE | This delay adds a pleasant wavering effect to the sound. |
| WARP | Produces a dream-like sound. |
| TWIST | Produces an aggressive sense of rotation. Using this in conjunction with distortion will produce an even wilder sense of rotation. |
| GLITCH | Creates a machine gun-like delay effect. |
| TIME \*1 | 1–2000 ms, BPM Ō–ŀ | Adjusts the delay time.   * When set to BPM, the value of each parameter will be set according to the value of the “MASTER BPM” specified for each memory. This makes it easier to achieve effect sound settings that match the tempo of the song. * If, due to the tempo, the time is longer than the range of allowable settings, it is then synchronized to a period either 1/2 or 1/4 of that time. * ŀ is a double whole note, which is twice as long as a whole note. |
| FEEDBACK \*2 | 0–100 | Adjusts the volume of delay that is returned to the input. Higher settings will result in more delay repeats. |
| LEVEL \*2 | 1–120 | Adjusts the volume of the delay sound. |
| HIGH CUT \*2 | 20.0 Hz–12.5 kHz, FLAT | Sets the frequency at which the high cut filter begins to take effect. When FLAT is selected, the high cut filter has no effect. |
| MOD RATE \*3 | 0–100 | Adjusts the modulation rate of the delay sound. |
| MOD DEPTH \*3 | 0–100 | Adjusts the modulation depth of the delay sound. |
| MODE \*4 | RISEÓFALL | Rotation stops when you switch TRIGGER from ON to OFF. |
| RISEÓFADE | When you switch TRIGGER from ON to OFF, fade-out occurs while continuing the rotation. |
| TRIGGER \*5 | OFF, ON | If this is ON, the effect is applied. |
| LEVEL \*5 | 0–100 | Adjusts the volume of the effect sound. |
| RISE TIME \*4 | 0–100 | This parameter adjusts the amount of time it is to take for the effect to transition to the maximum. |
| FALL TIME \*4 | 0–100 | Adjusts the time it takes for the rotation effect to stop when MODE changes from RISE to FALL. |
| TIME \*6 | 0–100 | Adjusts the length of the effect sound. |
| GLITCH \*6 | 0–100 | Adjusts the intensity of the effect. |
| BALANCE \*6 | 0–100 | Adjusts the volume balance between the direct sound and effect sound. A setting of “100” mutes the direct sound. |
