# Ns (noise suppressor)

![](../Images/png/91951371__Web.png)HEXARAY: Reduction meter

This effect reduces the noise and hum picked up by guitar pickups. Since it suppresses the noise in synchronization with the envelope of the guitar sound (the way in which the guitar sound decays over time), it has very little effect on the guitar sound, and does not harm the natural character of the sound.

| Parameter | Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| THRESHOLD | 0–100 | Adjust this parameter as appropriate for the volume of the noise. If the noise level is high, a higher setting is appropriate. Adjust the value so that the decay of the guitar sound sounds natural.   * High settings for the threshold parameter may result in there being no sound when you play with your guitar volume turned down. |
| RELEASE | 0–100 | Adjusts the time from when the noise suppressor begins to function until the noise level reaches “0”. |
| DETECT | This controls the noise suppressor based on the volume level for the point specified in Detect. | |
| INPUT | Input volume from input jack.   * Ordinarily, DETECT should be set to “INPUT”. |
| NS INPUT | Noise suppressor input volume.   * When connected as illustrated below, and you want to prevent a spatial-type effects sound (such as a delay sound) from being eradicated by the NS, you should set DETECT to “NS INPUT”.     Spatial-type effect |
| ON/OFF | OFF, ON | Turns this effect on/off. |
