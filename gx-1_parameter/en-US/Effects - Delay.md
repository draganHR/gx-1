This produces a variety of delay sounds ranging from simple effects to richly idiosyncratic sounds. This effect is a useful way of adding depth to the sound.

| Parameter | Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ON/OFF | OFF, ON | Turns this effect on/off. |
| TYPE | Selects the type of wah. |  |
|  | STANDARD | Delays the sound to create an echo-like effect. |
|  | MODULATE | This delay adds a pleasant wavering effect to the sound. |
|  | PAN | This delay is specifically for stereo output.  This allows you to obtain the tap delay effect that divides the delay time, then deliver them to L and R channels. |
|  | REVERSE | Produces a reverse playback effect. |
|  | ANALOG | Gives a mild analog delay sound. |
|  | ANLG MOD | An analog delay to which a pleasant modulation is added. |
|  | SPACE ECHO | Models the Roland RE-201. |
|  | SHIMMER | Delay with pitch-shifted sound mixed in. |
|  | WARP | Produces a dream-like sound. |
|  | TWIST | Produces an aggressive sense of rotation. Using this in conjunction with distortion will produce an even wilder sense of rotation. |
|  | GLITCH | Creates a machine gun-like delay effect. |
