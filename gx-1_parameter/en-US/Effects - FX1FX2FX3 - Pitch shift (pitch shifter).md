This effect changes the pitch of the original sound (up or down) within a range of two octaves.

| Parameter | Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ON/OFF | OFF, ON | Turns this effect on/off. |
| PITCH | -24–+24 | Adjusts the amount of pitch shift (the amount of interval) in semitone steps. |
| +7&-5, +12&-5 | Two pitch-shifted voices are output in mono. |
| MODE | FAST, MEDIUM, SLOW, MONO | The response is slower in the order of FAST, MEDIUM and SLOW, but the modulation is lessened in the same order. |
| LEVEL | 0–100 | Adjusts the volume of the pitch shifter. |
| PRE-DELAY | 0–300 ms, BPM ŀ–Ō | Adjusts the time from when the direct sound is heard until the pitch shifted sounds are heard. Normally you can leave this set at 0 ms.   * When set to BPM, the value of each parameter will be set according to the value of the “MASTER BPM” specified for each memory. This makes it easier to achieve effect sound settings that match the tempo of the song. * If, due to the tempo, the time is longer than the range of allowable settings, it is then synchronized to a period either 1/2 or 1/4 of that time. * ŀ is a double whole note, which is twice as long as a whole note. |
| FEEDBACK | 0–100 | Adjusts the feedback amount of the pitch shift sound. |
| DIRECT | 0–100 | Adjusts the volume of the direct sound. |
